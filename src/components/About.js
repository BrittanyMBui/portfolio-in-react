        <p>
        I come from quite a diverse background as far as life and work experiences. I spent the better part of the last decade bartending, owning a small business, and intermittently pursuing my dream career of software engineering. It wasnâ€™t until late 2020 after officially losing my bartending job to covid that I was able to finally put 100% into making my dream a reality. I have a great love and genuine enjoyment for developing back end functionality. I especially enjoy working with APIs and building back end application functionality using Express, Node, and MongoDB.
            <br />I spend most of my time coding because I genuinely <strong>love</strong> it, 
            <br />but when I'm not coding you might find me working out, binging Netflix, or playing RPG's.
            <br />
