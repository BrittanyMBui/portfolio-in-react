        <p>
            I'm a full stack engineer based in San Francisco, CA. My focus is mainly on back-end functionality with some emphasis on front-end user experience functionality. I spend most of my time coding because I genuinely <strong>love</strong> it, but when I'm not coding you might find me cooking, binging Netflix, or playing RPG's.
