        <p>
            I'm a full stack software engineer based in San Francisco, CA. 
            <br />My focus is on back-end functionality with emphasis on front-end user experience functionality. 
            <br />I spend most of my time coding because I genuinely <strong>love</strong> it, 
            <br />but when I'm not coding you might find me working out, binging Netflix, or playing RPG's.
        </p>
    </div>
