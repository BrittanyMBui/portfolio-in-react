        <p>
        I come from quite a diverse background as far as life and work experiences. 
        I spent the better part of the last decade bartending, owning a small business, 
        and intermittently pursuing my dream career of software engineering. 
        It wasnâ€™t until late 2020 after officially losing my service industry job to COVID-19 that I was able to finally put 100% into making my dream a reality.
        I deeply enjoy working on any part of the stack, with emphasis on backend development. I especially love working with and building out APIs.
            <br />I spend most of my time coding because I genuinely <strong>love</strong> it, 
            <br />but when I'm not coding you might find me working out, binging Netflix, or playing RPGs.
            <br />
